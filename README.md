Updated list of around 15K facebook domain names from the CIDR range of facebook

This is one of the biggest facebook domain names created from the publicly available CIDR information 
and DNS Lookup of the available IP range.

It contains about 15022 domain names including the instagram, facebook, messenger and other facebook services.

There is a hosts version if you would like to import them into the respective hosts file.

Use at your own risk. Still the list does not prevent all the facebook snooping and access, but
something is better than no protection. Having it in the hosts file prevents even the accidental access.

Habits die hard! Don't they? ;-)

Peace out!
